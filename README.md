# DFA_Interpreter
The program is written to process a Deterministic Finite State Automata. The program reads its input from two files: the first file encodes the DFA transition table including the transitions, states, and characters used. While the second file contains the input string. This program will out “Yes” if the automaton defined by the transition table accepts the input string, and “No” otherwise.

This repository includes an example textfile for a transition table. If entering a new transition table file, the format must remain the same as the example file. This repository also two example string textfiles: validString.txt and invalidString.txt.
